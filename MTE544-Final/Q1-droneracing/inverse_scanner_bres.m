function [m] = inverse_scanner_bres(M, N, x, y, theta, r, rmax, rmin, p_occ, p_free)
% Calculates the inverse measurement model for a laser scanner through
% raytracing with Bresenham's algorithm, assigns low probability of object
% on ray, high probability at end. Returns matrix of cell probabilities.
%
% Input:
%   M = Total Height of map
%   N = Total Width of map
%   x = Robot x position
%   y = Robot y position
%   theta = Angle of sensor
%   r = Range to measured object
%   rmax = Max range of sensor
%   p_occ = Probability of an occupied cell
%   p_free = Probability of an unoccupied cell
% Output:
%   m = Matrix representing the inverse measurement model

if (nargin<9)
    p_occ = 0.7;
    p_free = 0.3;
end

% Bound the robot within the map dimensions
x1 = max(1, min(M, round(x)));
y1 = max(1, min(N, round(y)));

% Calculate position of measured object (endpoint of ray)
endpt = [x y] + r * [cos(theta) sin(theta)];

% Bound the endpoint within the map dimensions
x2 = max(1, min(M, round(endpt(1))));
y2 = max(1, min(N, round(endpt(2))));

% Get coordinates of all cells traversed by laser ray

% Assign probabilities
m = [coordlist p_free * ones(length(coordlist(:, 1)), 1)];
